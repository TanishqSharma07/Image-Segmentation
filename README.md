# Image-Segmentation
Here, We aim to acheive image segmentation using U-net Architecture
U-net Consists of two parts:
* Encoder
* Decoder

## Encoder
for the encoder we have used a pretrained model (MobileNetV2)

## Decoder
The decoder consists of several upsampling blocks using transpose convolution layers
